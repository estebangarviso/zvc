<h4>ZVC Bootstrap Table - Basic Usage</h4>
<p>
    Configuration is done in HTML using data-z attributes on table and columns (and pagination if it uses).
    Data is passed to table as an array of rows. Each row is an object with fields with names declared in data-z-field attribute for TH elements in THEADER.
</p>
<p>
    Table can work with and without pagination. Pagination can be local or server side (request ecah page to server). 
    ZVC explicitly does not include Models (sevices, in this case) so data is requested to container elements using events, wich can asynchronously make requests to server to retrieve data.
</p>
<p>
    Container controller must call <code>refresh</code> method on table controller and table will request rows as needed via <code>getRows</code> event or a combination of <code>getRowsCount</code> and <code>getRowsPage</code><br />
    Remember that handlers for this events (like every handler in ZVC) could be declared <code>async</code> or return a <code>Promise</code> to make easy working with server side requests.
</p>
<p>
    In this basic example, no pagination is used, so event handler returns all rows (filtered by text) using services in sample CustomersModel presented in Introduction.

    Example includes a navbar with a TextSearch component to filter customers. Enter a number to see how it works.
