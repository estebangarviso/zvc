<h4>ZVC Bootstrap Table - Dialog Based Edition</h4>
<p>
    There are many patterns to implement record edition in web applications. We explore here Dialog based edition and Inline Record Edition.
</p>
<p>
    Dialog based edition uses standard ZVC components and ZDialogs to edit a single row in a table. 
</p>
<p>
    Using custom cells we add icons to edit and delete a row. After edition an deletion, a refresh is needed because order of records (and pagination) could be affected.<br />
    Additionally, we added a button to navbar to add new Customer, using the same Dialog for new records and existing ones.
