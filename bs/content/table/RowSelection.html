<h4>ZVC Bootstrap Table - Row Selection</h4>
<p>
    ZVC Bootstrap Table can be configured to handle a single row selection.
    Table will trigger a "change" event each time row selection change, even with no selection.
</p>
<p>
    Change event includes selected row and selected row index.
</p>
<p>
    To configure a table with row selection, just add a data-z-selected-row-class with the class name of selected row.
    You can use one of predefines classes in bootstrap for table rows.
