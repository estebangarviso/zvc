<h4>ZDynamicSelect</h4>
<p>ZSelect components are created atomatically for "SELECT" HTML tags with an id and data-z-id-field and data-z-label-field attributes.</p>
<p>
    Dynamic Select maintain an array of objects (rows). Attributes in view are used to select the field to use as label and as value in select.
</p>
<p>
    Use "setRows" method to fill rows in component. Optionally pass an initial value (id-field) as a pre-selected row.
</p>
<p>
    Use "value" property to obtain "id" field for selected row (or null) or "selectedRow" property to get the full selected row. 
    ZDynamicSelect extends ZSelect, so "value" property is available for getting and setting the id of selected row and getSelectedText() to get label from selected text.
