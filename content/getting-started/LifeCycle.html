<hr />
<p>
    Base components, library components (included scripts) and Custom Components (user created) follows same life cycle.
    Events corresponding to life cycle are triggered to components from themselves, so they can be captured using <code>onThis_eventName()</code>.

    Life Cycle Events
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>init</code><br />
            Init event is triggered after creation of component is complete and after init event was triggered inside every child component (and it's own subcomponentes, recursively). 
            This event can be used to register DOM listeners or to initialize default values for properties and component fields or custom subcomponents initialization.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>activated</code> and <code>deactivated</code><br />
            Activated event is triggered after initialization and when component is ready to interact with the user. 
            Deactivated evet is triggered just before component becomes invisible. This can be temporary or before it will be destroyed. For example, a ZLoader calls deactivate on current (loaded) component before loading the new one (calling init and activated in the new one).
        </li>
    </ul>
